            <h3>Description:</h3>
            <p>The Well-Grounded Rubyist teaches you Ruby from the ground up—covering foundational topics and leading you to advanced techniques with clarity and care. Written by Ruby expert David A. Black, this book dives deep into the Ruby programming language while maintaining a practical, example-driven approach. You’ll start with the basics—working with data types, variables, methods, and classes. As you progress, you’ll explore Ruby’s unique take on object orientation, blocks and iterators, mixins, and more. The third edition is updated for Ruby 2.5 and includes modern best practices and Ruby idioms. Whether you’re new to Ruby or a seasoned developer, this book will help you think and code like a true Rubyist.</p>

                <h4>Review #1 Title:  A Solid Foundation for Any Rubyist</h4>
                <p>Reviewer #1:  Jessica Tran</p>
                <p>Review #1 Date:  April 15, 2021</p>
                <p>Review #1:</p>
                <p>This is the book I wish I had when I first started learning Ruby. David A. Black has a clear and thoughtful teaching style that makes even the trickier parts of the language feel approachable. The pacing is just right—starting with basics like variables and gradually moving to more advanced topics like metaprogramming and mixins.</p>
                <p>What I appreciate most is how much care is put into explaining why Ruby behaves the way it does, not just how it works. The examples are relevant and digestible, and the exercises help reinforce what you’ve just read. Even as someone who’s been working with Ruby for a few years, I found myself picking up new insights.</p>
                <p>Highly recommend this book if you’re looking to build a strong Ruby foundation or fill in gaps in your knowledge.</p>

                <h4>Review #2 Title:  Comprehensive, Clear, and Rubyist-Friendly</h4>
                <p>Reviewer #2:  Michael Stone</p>
                <p>Review #2 Date:  January 9, 2020</p>
                <p>Review #2:</p>
                <p>The Well-Grounded Rubyist is exactly what the title promises. It not only teaches Ruby syntax, but it teaches the philosophy and idioms behind the language. David A. Black walks you through key concepts with patience and clarity, never assuming too much but never dumbing things down either.</p>
                <p>One of my favorite things about this book is how it encourages writing elegant, idiomatic Ruby—code that’s both functional and beautiful. It’s also packed with little gems (pun intended) of knowledge that helped me understand Ruby more deeply than I ever had before.</p>
                <p>If you’re moving into Ruby from another language or even just refreshing your skills, this book is a must-read.</p>
